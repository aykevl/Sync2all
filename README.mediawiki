= Google Chrome synchronization =

This is an extension that synchronizes Google Chrome (or Chromium or Iron or ... ) with Google Bookmarks and Opera Link.

== Supported protocols ==

=== Google Bookmarks ===

Works very well, although the two use a completely different system to store folder names. The extension uses slashes to split the path names.

=== Opera Link ===

Opera Link works, thanks to ChaosinaCan (see Credits). It uses a system more common than that of Google Bookmarks.

The only drawback is, that it doesn't use the bookmarks bar.


=== Firefox Sync ===

Not yet because it is very hard to decode the encrypted bookmarks (And I won't even think of encrypting them...). See https://bitbucket.org/philikon/weaveclient-chromium/ for an extension that tries it, but doesn't work anymore. I am working on a Firefox extension. Such an extension can synchronize with Google Bookmarks or Opera link and synchronize bookmarks that way.

== Supported browsers ==

=== Chrome ===
(Or Iron, Chromium, Flock...)

Supported. This was the first browser I made the extension on. Initially, I wanted to write a Chrome extension that would sync with Google Bookmarks, but I have extended the extension by moving the browser-specific and Google Bookmarks-specific code in separate modules (files, classes).

It doesn't work yet the way I want: it only syncs the bookmarks bar, not the Other Bookmarks.

=== Firefox ===

First version works!. It has lots of bugs and a lot of functionality is not supported, but that it works is the most important thing. I wouldn't recommend to use it except when you want to debug and/or help developing the extension. And always make a backup of your bookmarks before you loose them (or make a complete mess of it).

Opera Link works now too in Firefox! It doesn't work perfectly, but I use it already for my day-to-day work.

It uses an XPCOM component as background page.

=== Opera ===

I don't work on this anymore. It is currently only useful to make such an extension for syncing Opera (Link) with Google Bookmarks. It would be much easier to just use Opera's built-in bookmarks system, but that is currently not possible.


== Installation ==

Download the .zip file (the big 'Download' button on the Github page -- this page) and rename the .zip to .crx (Chrome) or .xpi (Firefox) and open it with the browser. That works for Chrome, but doesn't for Firefox for some reason (says the file is corrupt?). EDIT: to let it work in Firefox, unzip the .zip file and zip the contents of that folder, not the folder itself.
